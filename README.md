# CostOptimizationSolution

I have used ChatGPT for generating the Azure function codes. The Prompt for the same is :

"Can you please provide the Azure Function code for implementing the hot-cold data tiering solution, where billing records older than 3 months are moved from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage, and a fallback function is used to retrieve old records from Blob Storage if they are not found in Cosmos DB?"
